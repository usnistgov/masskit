--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Masskit is a Python package for easy-to-use, efficient and flexible computing on mass spectra.
Masskit does this by taking advantage of modern software and hardware architectures.  It features:
- Functions to filter, normalize, annotate, plot and compute on mass spectra.
- Searching and indexing of spectral libraries.
- Reading and writing of multiple file formats.
- Computational algorithms for small molecules, including reactions.
- Algorithms and encodings for peptides.
- Use of columnar memory for optimal efficiency in distributed, multicore computation.
