  ${hydra.help.app_name}: Reformat pre v2000 version sdf files into those 
  usable by rdkit by appending missing M END lines. Turns any latin-1 
  characters into the unicode expected by the rdkit SDF parser.

  Example:

  `${hydra.help.app_name} input.file.name=my_sdf.sdf output.file.name=output.sdf`

  Different ways to configure ${hydra.help.app_name}:

  Applications can be configured two ways: by using hierarchically
  organized configuration files written in the YAML format and
  overriding individual configuration values found in the YAML
  formatted files on the command line. 
  
  To override individual configuration values, use 
  the name=value syntax on the command line, where name is the dot notation 
  that reflects the indentation of the configuration in the default 
  configuration. For example, a setting of:

  input:
    file:
      name: my_file.txt
  
  would be set on the command line as `input.file.name=my_file.txt`. The 
  default configuration for ${hydra.help.app_name} is:
 
  $CONFIG
  Values can be specified in various ways.  A value of `null` means an empty
  value. Strings with spaces can be specified by enclosing them in quotes. 
  Lists can be specified using the notation `[1,2,3]`. `true` and `false` are 
  boolean values.

  The configuration groups can be found in separate yaml files for some
  applications. yaml is a simple indented text format for configuration
  settings. If available, compose your configuration from these groups:

  $APP_CONFIG_GROUPS
