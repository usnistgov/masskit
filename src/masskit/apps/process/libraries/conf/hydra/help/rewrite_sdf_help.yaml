  ${hydra.help.app_name}: Reformat pre v2000 version sdf files into those 
  usable by rdkit by appending missing M END lines. Turns any latin-1 
  characters into the unicode expected by the rdkit SDF parser.

  Example:
  `${hydra.help.app_name} input.file.name=my_sdf.sdf output.file.name=output.sdf`

  Applications can be configured two ways: by groups of configurations and
  overriding individual configuration values. 
  
  To override individual configuration values, use 
  the name=value syntax on the command line, where name is the dot notation 
  that reflects the indentation of the configuration in the default 
  configuration. For example, a setting of:

  input:
    file:
      name: my_file.txt
  
  would be set on the command line as `input.file.name=my_file.txt`. The 
  default configuration for ${hydra.help.app_name} is:
 
  $CONFIG
  Values can be specified in various ways.  A value of `null` means an empty
  value. Strings with spaces can be specified by enclosing them in quotes. 
  Lists can be specified using the notation `[1,2,3]`. `true` and `false` are 
  boolean values.

  The configuration groups can be found in separate yaml files for some
  applications. yaml is a simple indented text format for configuration
  settings. If available, compose your configuration from these groups:

  $APP_CONFIG_GROUPS
