  ${hydra.help.app_name}: Takes as input a parquet file containing molecules
  and generates derivatives of the molecules and their tautomers.

  Examples:

  `${hydra.help.app_name} input.file.names=mysdf.sdf output.file.name=output.msp`

  `${hydra.help.app_name} input.file.names=mysdf.msp output.file.name=output
    output.file.types=[parquet,msp] conversion/msp=msp_peptide`

  Common command line options:

  input.file.name
  name of the parquet file to input

  output.file.name
  name of the parquet file to output

  

  conversion.reactant_names=[methylation,acetylation,trifluoroacetylation,t-butyldimethylsilylation,trimethylsilylation]
  the name of the derivativation reaction to use.  defaults to trimethylsilylation.

  conversion.functional_group_names=[alcohol,carboxyl,amine,pyrrole,amide,thiol]
  the functional groups that are derivatized. By default all are used

  conversion.num_tautomers=0
  the number of tautomers to generate per derivatized structure. 0 is the default

  conversion.mass_range=[0,5000]
  a mass range in Daltons the products of the derivativation are limited to. Unlimited by default

  conversion.max_products=1000
  the maximum number of derivatives generated per input molecule. 1000 by default

  conversion.max_passes=100
  the number of times the derivativation reaction is applied to a given product. 100 by default

  conversion.include_original_molecules=True
  should the original underivatized molecule be inclcuded in the output? True by default

  Different ways to configure ${hydra.help.app_name}:

  Applications can be configured two ways: by using hierarchically
  organized configuration files written in the YAML format and
  overriding individual configuration values found in the YAML
  formatted files on the command line. 
  
  To override individual configuration values, use 
  the name=value syntax on the command line, where name is the dot notation 
  that reflects the indentation of the configuration in the default 
  configuration. For example, a setting of:

  input:
    file:
      name: my_file.txt
  
  would be set on the command line as `input.file.name=my_file.txt`. The 
  default configuration for ${hydra.help.app_name} is:
 
  $CONFIG
  Values can be specified in various ways.  A value of `null` means an empty
  value. Strings with spaces can be specified by enclosing them in quotes. 
  Lists can be specified using the notation `[1,2,3]`. `true` and `false` are 
  boolean values.

  The configuration groups can be found in separate yaml files for some
  applications. yaml is a simple indented text format for configuration
  settings. If available, compose your configuration from these groups:

  $APP_CONFIG_GROUPS
